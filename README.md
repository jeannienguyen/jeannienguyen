# Hi, I'm Jeannie 👋🏼

![Repository Banner](jeannienguyen-banner.png)

I'm a software engineer in LA who loves to create technology that elevates others and builds community. 🌎&nbsp; I bring stories to life through code and write about my journey as a developer. I have 3+ years of experience working on growth initiatives, A/B testing & experimentation, and building seamless frontend designs + user experiences. I'm familiar with a variety of programming languages, including React, TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS, but am always looking to add to my skillset.
